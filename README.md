## NMN supplementation rescues cerebromicrovascular endothelial function and neurovascular coupling responses in aged mice

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6477631/

young and aged C57BL/6 mice, fed a standard AIN-93G diet, were given daily doses of NMN of 500mg/kg body weight (injected) for 14 days

3 and 24 month old F344xBN rats - 5 × 10−4 mM NMN, for 5 days

results - neurovascular couplings (NVC) responses and cerebral blood flow (CBF) were measured by applying electrostimulation to the subjects 

        - NVC were restored to levels similar to those shown in young mice

        - NO synthase inhibitor l-NAME limits NVC responses, eliminating the differences between     the age groups - NMN improves endothelial function

          restoring endothelial NO mediation in aged vessels

        - attenuation of mitochondrial oxidative stress - effects of NMN were assessed using cultures of CMVEC's

         - aged CMVEC's showed decreased levels of NAD+ (50%) while NMN treated CMVEC values were normal

         - attenuation of mtROS production which is linked to decreased levels of NO  impaired mitochondrial membrane potential and decreased cellular ATP levels

         - mitochondrial membrane potential retained the same value as in young CMVEC (vs 20% decrease) while cellular ATP levels only decreased by 20% (vs 60% decrease in aged CMVEC's)

        - NMN doesn't promote mitochondrial biogenesis - mitochondrial volume density in endothelial cells in the cerebral microcirculation was unaffected by NMN treatment  as well as mtDNA in cerebral arteries 

## NMN supplementation promotes anti-aging miRNA expression profile in the aorta of aged mice

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6815288/

Diet - standard AIN-93G

dosing - 500 mg NMN/kg body daily spread across 14 days

         sacrificed 4h after last injection

 Results - the expression profile of mouse miRNAs in aortas derived from young and aged      control mice and aged NMN-treated mice was analyzed

             - similarities were revealed on miRNA expression profiles of aortas from young and  NMN-treated aged mice

             - nmn treatment partly reverses age-related, pro-inflammatory, and pro-atherogenic alterations in miRNA expression profile in the aorta

## NMN treatment attenuates oxidative stress and rescues angiogenic capacity in aged cerebromicrovascular endothelial cells

Fischer 344x Brown Norway rats (lower risk of age related pathology) ages 3m and 24m

dosing unknown

effects of nmn on cell proliferation, migration and tube formation ability in CMVEC (cerebromicrovascular endothelial cells)

cell proliferation - measured using flow cytometry 

                  marker - cmsfe - inverse correlation between fluorescence intensity and the   proliferation cap of cells

                             40 % increase vs aged mice

 cell migration - measured using ECIS-based wound-healing

               - aged CMVEC's+NMN show an improvement of the cell migration rate (vs aged CMVEC's) of 35%

tube formation - aged CMVEC's show an impairment to generating capillary networks while              CMVEC's+NMN show an improvement

               - NAD+ deficiency is linked to impaired angiogenic capacity of CMVEC's

                 leading to inhibition of SIRT1 that stopped the formation of capillary

                 like structures

## NMN treatment resulted in dramatic attenuation of H2O2 production in aged CMVECs

Effect of oral administration of nicotinamide mononucleotide on clinical parameters

https://sci-hub.tw/10.1507/endocrj.EJ19-0313

10 male subjects aged 40-60 with no previous disease history

oral doses of 100, 250, 500mg administered to avoid side effects (single dose)

vital signs were unaffected

urine and blood samples were taken periodically two and four hours after ingestion

    -methylnicotinamide (MNA), N-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide (2Py), N-methyl-4-pyridone-5-carboxamide (4Py)

     seem to increase with a higher dose

    -no NMN was detected - failure to analyze blood samples before the substance shifted into its metabolites

the serum levels of bilirubin significantly increased by 51.3%, the levels of glucose, 

creatinine, and chloride significantly decreased by11.7%, 5.1%, and 2.3%

but this is most probably caused by fasting 

seems safe to ingest idk lol

## Mitigates age-associated physiological decline in mice

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5668137/
C57BL/6N - PicoLab 5053 Rodent Diet
                  - 100mg/kg and 300mg/kg doses administered orally daily for a year (starting age 5mo)


Results - suppressed age associated body weight gain possibly related to higher energy expenditure in the NMN groups. Oxygen consumption increased, as well, for both groups. The end of the study period seems to point out that these maintained themselves at levels similar to the ones found in control subjects halfway through the experiment

    Insulin levels increased over time in all groups, while fed and fasted glucose remained constant, although the 300g NMN group showed significantly lower insulin levels 3 to 9 months after

Tissues samples (skeletal muscle, liver, WAT)  were taken halfway and at the end of the study; 300, 360, and 513 genes were significantly changed in the control group, while in the NMN groups they were prevalently left unchanged (76.3%, 73.1%, and 41.7%), although no common genes were observed in the top 20 genes

## Reduces Metabolic Impairment in Male Mouse Offspring from Obese Mothers

https://sci-hub.tw/10.3390/cells9040791

C56BL6/J female mice were divided into two groups, one being fed a normal diet, the other a high fat diet (HFD). 

The male offspring of these two groups were subjected to the same conditions. After being weaned (29w), some of them were given NMN treatment (500mg/kg ip) for 3 weeks before being sacrificed. Glucose and insulin levels were measured throughout the experiment.

Results - as expected, pups from HFD mothers were heavier, regardless of their diet.  NMN treatment lowered fat% in both groups but significantly reduced body weight in male offspring of lean mothers who consumed a HFD.
  - NMN impaired glucose tolerance in mice (regular diet)  from lean mothers (40% increase vs control) while the HFD ones were unaffected. Lower blood sugar levels as well as higher plasmatic insulin levels were observed only in the most metabolically compromised.

Hepatic expression - for offspring consuming HFD from obese and lean mothers, NMN significantly reduced the mRNA expression of Acc1, Mpc1 and Cd36; 

Cpt1, Fabp and Fasn mRNA expression was reduced significantly by NMN treatment in mice fed on HFD from obese mothers (NMN is effective in ameliorating programmed liver triglyceride accumulation than solely diet-induced accumulation?)

## Promotes neurovascular rejuvenation in aged mice: transcriptional footprint of SIRT1 activation, mitochondrial protection, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic effects

https://sci-hub.tw/10.1007/s11357-020-00165-5

C57BL/6 mice - AIN-93G diet

  - NMN injections (500mg/kg) for two weeks

Results - unsupervised clustering of RNA-seq data from all samples using the topmost variably expressed genes across all samples showed a separation between control vs young , as well as a clear distinction between the control group vs NMN; mRNA expression in young mice and NMN-treated aged mice were similar

- NMN-induced SIRT1 activation upregulates PGC-1α (PPARGC1A), FOXO3- and FOXO4-mediated pathways, while inhibiting HIF-1α2

## RNA expression profiles altered by nicotinamide mononucleotide therapy in a chronic model of alcoholic liver disease

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6902345/

C57BL/6 J mice
The diets consisted of 44% fat-derived calories, 16% protein-derived calories and the remaining balance being comprised of either carbohydrate or ethanol-derived calories (EDC). Ethanol-fed mice started the study on a diet consisting of 2% ethanol (v/v), with ethanol-derived calories (EDC) increased on a weekly basis until sacrifice
Divided into 4 groups: normal and ethanol diet both divided into control and NMN groups
NMN dose 500mg/kg every other day


Results - biomarkers for alcohol induced liver damage - ALT and AST; NMN prevented the rise of both markers in ethanol fed mice, but other characteristics such as triglycerides, liver to body weight and ethanol plasma levels  were left unchanged (consequence of using an early-stage model of alcohol liver disease?)
NMN shots negated the NAD+ depleting effects of ethanol, as well as preventing the the loss of certain TCA cyle metabolites, such as pyruvate and 2-oxoglutarate

RNA sequencing revealed that 437 genes (about 25%) were dependent of the NMN treatment, meaning they might be left unaltered by ethanol consumption. NMN-dependent ethanol genes are associated with numerous pathways, including amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism and MAPK (Mitogen-activated protein kinases) signaling pathway; NMN  prevented the inhibitory effect of ethanol on Erk1/2 phosphorylation

## Ameliorates the depression-like behaviors and is associated with attenuating the disruption of mitochondrial bioenergetics in depressed mice

https://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/j.jad.2019.11.147

Male C57/BL6 mice divided into: control, CORT and CORT NMN
CORT - 20mg/kg for 6 weeks
NMN - 300g/kg orally for the last 2 weeks


Results - behavior seems mostly unchanged/irrelevant  imo; body weight decrease caused by CORT disappeared after NMN treatment
NMN administration affected the expression of genes involved in lipid transport; 50 metabolites were upregulated, predominantly adenosine and glutathione, while 119 were downregulated, mostly related to lipids (decrease in lipid synthesis?)
NAMPT and NAD+ increase in the hippocampus caused by CORT was alleviated by NMN administration; NMN also restored SIRT3 activity levels to normal 

## Protects the Heart from Ischemia and Reperfusion

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4048236/

Sirt1flox/flox mice with C57BL/6J background and α-myosin heavy chain promoter–driven Cre mice crossbreed
Caloric restriction was applied 90% (Dustless Precision Pellets 1 gm) first week followed by 60% (Dustless Precision Pellets 1 gm 40% DR)
500mg/kg injections were done 30 mins prior to applying ischemia and 30 after harvesting the heart


Results - NMN increased both NAD+ content and the NAD+/NADH ratio in the heart with or without ischemia. Moreover, the decreases in the NAD+ content and NAD+/NADH ratio observed after 30 min of ischemia in PBS-injected mice were normalized after NMN administration
4 groups were injected at different times: 12 hours before ischemia, 30 minutes before, immediately after reperfusion, and repetitive administration after. 1 and 3 had no effect, while the rest presented amelioration of tissue necrosis of 44% and 29% relative to their control groups (application of NMN can mimic the effect of IPC?)
Myocardial ischemia significantly increased acetylation of FoxO1, a major target of Sirt1, whereas NMN significantly attenuated ischemia-induced increases in FoxO1 acetylation 

## Nicotinamide Mononucleotide and Melatonin Alleviate Aging-induced 4 Cognitive Impairment

https://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/j.neuroscience.2019.09.037

male Wistar rats divided into five groups - Young+Normal saline (NS), Aged+NS, Aged+Melatonin, Aged+NMN, and Aged+melatonin+NMN.
Melatonin - 10  mg/kg
NMN - 100 mg/kg both injected for 28 days every other day

Results - Brain mitochondrial ROS production - marker DCFDA - ROS levels showed increased levels in aged control group in the prefrontal cortex, the rest remained at similar levels; hippocampus ROS levels all seemed to increase with age, treatment managing to alleviate it partially  
Brain mitochondria membrane potential - JC-1 vital dye - aged subjects presented reduced MPP in the PFC and HIP; NMN and NMN + melatonin prevented MPP drop

 Brain ATP levels - aging produced a drop in ATP levels; combination treatment seemed to have prevented that

## Melatonin and Nicotinamide Mononucleotide Attenuate Myocardial Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury

https://sci-hub.tw/10.1177/1074248419882002

Wistar rats - 5 groups - sham group (without I/R), control group, melatonin group, NMN group and combined group
NMN - 100mg/kg every other day for 28 days
Melatonin (50 microM) was administered 5 minutes before reperfusion up to 15 minutes of reperfusion
An obstruction of the coronary flow of 25% was applied

Results -  LVEDP (left ventricular diastolic pressure something) were raised during I/R, all treatment groups  showing lower levels than control group
LDH release - linked to myocardial damage - NMN treatment showed a lower value similar to administering melatonin during reperfusion
Infract size was decreased in NMN and NMN+mel 
NMN prevented the drop in NAD+/NADH levels
Oxidative stress markers in heart - MDA (malondialdehyde) level as indicator of peroxidation and SOD (superoxide dismutase) and GPX (glutathione peroxidase) levels as enzymatic antioxidants; increase in MDA attenuates the activity of SOD and GPX, all treatment showed higher activity levels than control

## Promotes osteogenesis and reduces adipogenesis by regulating mesenchymal stromal cells via the SIRT1 pathway

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6472410/

Prx1-Cre mice and ColA1flox-stop-flox-SIRT1 mice
NMN administered orally 100mg/kg and 300 mg/kg ?

Results - Colony-forming unit-fibroblast frequency correlates with NMN dosage; NMN promotes Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) expansion and may be a useful tool to enhance MSC frequency in vivo; 50% increase after 3mo

When CFU-F is induced with osteoblast and adipocyte lineages - 20% increase in osteoblasts vs control and 27% decrease in adipocytes

When MSC’s were subjected to ionising radiation, NMN treated cells were subjected to 75% less  damage vs control (in vitro)

## Alters mitochondrial dynamics by SIRT3 dependent mechanism in male mice

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6565489/

Adult, 3 months old C57Bl6 male mice
NMN - 62.5mg/kg doses injected

Samples collected 15 minutes, 1, 4, 24, and 48 hours after injection

Results - 1h after NMN dose spherical mitochondrial population - 5% decrease while rod shaped sees a 5% increase 

60% decrease in levels of the active form of fission protein, phosphorylated Drp1 in the hippocampal mitochondria from 15 min to 4 hours post NMN treatment 

hippocampal mitochondrial NAD+ are increased after treatment and remain elevated 24h after - NMN increases mitochondrial global protein acetylation 3-fold vs control -  mitochondrial acetyltransferase GCN5L1

changes in hippocampal ROS levels ? - indicator dihydroethidium (DHE)

## CA1 Nampt knockdown recapitulates hippocampal cognitive phenotypes in old mice

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6224504/

CA1-specific Nampt knockdown mice
Dosing 300mg/kg orally for 3weeks
primary hippocampal neurons were treated with FK866 at concentrations of 10 nM and 100 nM for 48 h. Cellular NAD+ levels decreased by 60 and 80% at 10 nM and 100 nM of FK866 - calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase (Cask - linked to cognitive dysfunctions such as mental retardation and such) responded most to the decrease

30% cask decrease with aging,along with NAMPT in hippocampus; NMN treatment sees cask increase 2 fold vs control, NAMPT unaffected

in the presence of SIRT1, the Cask promoter activity was significantly suppressed by EX527, a potent SIRT1 inhibitor - Cask is dependent to SIRT1 ?
